### ‚ö° Fun Fact  
During my Advanced Digital Design class, I built a line-tracking car using infrared sensors...  
It actually worked pretty well ‚Äî but only after I replaced a bunch of parts because the circuit exploded, the capacitor blew, and I fried the board twice!  
So yeah, the car tracked the line... eventually. And I got plenty of laughs and lessons out of the whole adventure üòÇ
