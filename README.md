- ⚡ Fun fact:  
  During my Advanced Digital Design class, I tried to build a line-tracking car using infrared sensors... but ran into so many problems that the circuit exploded, the capacitor blew, and I fried the board twice! So yeah, the car didn’t track the line, but I got plenty of laughs and lessons out of it 😂
